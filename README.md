# Classification_Decision_Tree_Cleveland_dataset
The goal of this notebook is to create a classification decision tree model for the Cleveland heart disease dataset.

# Below we have brief descriptions of what each of the features we are going to use mean. The numbers next to the features are the ones that were used in the original dataset.
#3 Age: age in years
#4 Sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
#9 Chest_pain_type
Value 1: typical angina
Value 2: atypical angina
Value 3: non-anginal pain
Value 4: asymptomatic
#10 At_rest_bp: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
#12 Cholesterol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
#16 Fast_blood_sug: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
#19 Rest_ecg: resting electrocardiographic results
Value 0: normal
Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
#32 Maxhr: thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
#38 Exer_angina: exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
#40 Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
#41 Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Value 1: upsloping
Value 2: flat
Value 3: downsloping
#44 Ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
#51 Thal: Thallium or stress test 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect. See this website for more info on the thallium or stress test.
#58 Diag: num: diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
Value 0: no vessel with 50% diameter narrowing
Value 1: one vessel with 50% diameter narrowing
Value 2,3,4: 2,3,4 vessels with 50% diameter narrowing
